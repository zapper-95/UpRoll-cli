# UpRoll CLI Tool

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

The **UpRoll CLI Tool** by Upnode enables chain operators and developers to efficiently configure and deploy OP Stack chains. You can create a chain configuration either through our [website](https://uproll-web.vercel.app/) or directly via the CLI.


Deployment is handled through the CLI. After building your chain using the website, deployment is as easy as running:
 ```
 uproll deploy -i [config_id]
 ```


For deployment, UpRoll uses a fork of the [optimism package](https://github.com/zapper-95/optimism-package) which provides greater levels of customisation. Unlike Conduit, which is a paid, closed-source solution that relies on third-party managed servers, UpRoll CLI Tool is free, open-source, and allows developers to deploy OP Stack chains on their own infrastructure with full transparency.



## Requirements
To run the CLI, you will first need to make sure you have the following programs:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 18 or higher and [Node package management](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) version 27 or higher
- [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install) latest version


**Install UpRoll CLI Tool**

```console
npm install -g @upnode/uproll-cli
```

**Verify version**

```console
uproll version
```

**Update version**

```console
npm update -g @upnode/uproll-cli
```


## Creating and Deploying a Chain

### Website + CLI

Our website allows you to create and store rollup configurations, which can then be used for deployment via the CLI.




#### 1. Create a Rollup Configuration
  1.  **Sign up** and navigate to the [Create Your Rollup](https://uproll-web.vercel.app/config) page
  2. Configure your chain settings and click **Save**
  3. Your configuration will be assigned a unique **configuration ID**

#### 2. Deploy Your Chain
To deploy your saved configuration, run:
```
uproll deploy -i [config_id]
```
Replace `config_id` with your chain's unique configuration ID.

You will then be prompted for the project name. Once entered, the chain configuration will be deployed.
### CLI Only
#### 1. Create a Rollup Configuration
Run the following command:
```
uproll run
```
Select **Deploy Rollup** from the menu.

You will then be prompted for values for various parameters. After confirming your selections, a valid configuration file will be generated automatically.

#### 2. Deploy your Chain
Deployment begins automatically once the configuration file is created. Alternatively, if you already have a configuration file, you can deploy it directly by running `uproll deploy -f [path/config.yaml]`



## Other Menu Options
All other menu options can be accessed by running:

```
uproll run
```

### Stop Rollup

This option stops a specific rollup from running and deletes its project folder. Since Kurtosis does not support restarting an enclave after stopping it, the rollup and its associated project folder are removed.

### Chain Info

After deployment, chain information is saved to a chain's project folder. 

The **Chain info** command retrieves files related to a rollup's deployment, such as `intent.toml` and `wallets.json` or its genesis file.

A list of active rollups is displayed. After selecting one, a list of available files appears. The chosen file is then displayed.

### Status of the deployment

This command displays the deployment status of a rollup, including each service.

### View logs

This command displays the log files of a particular rollup after it has been deployed.

### Clean

Kurtosis runs multiple Docker containers for each deployed chain, which can significantly impact your computer’s performance.

If you no longer need to run any chains, use the following command to stop and remove them.

**Note:** This will permanently delete their project folders, including all configuration files and logs.
